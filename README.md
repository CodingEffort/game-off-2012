# RepoRage

## Description
RepoRage is a source-control themed multiplayer vertical space shooter.

Players have to defeat incoming waves of bugs in order to make their project progress.

Whenever a player discovers a major bug (by dying), he creates a branch to work on it, with easier bugs to fix (or kill). Once he merges back the branch (by killing a boss), he can get back up a level in the repo, with the ultimate goal of getting back to work on the master branch.

When an important bug is killed in the master branch, the project advances to its next version, increasing the difficulty level of all the other branches Therefore, the game in itself has infinite gameplay.

Players can upgrade their weapons, their defenses, or even use special powerups. They can also go join branches in order to help other players to progress through the game.
